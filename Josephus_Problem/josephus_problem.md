## Josephus Problem

It is the 1st century AD. Josephus and his other $N - 1$ soldiers find themselves besieged by Roman troops under 
the commander, later to be Roman Emperor, Vespasian. They decide that they would rather commit suicide or fall to a 
comrade than to the Romans. They form a circle and agree that the first soldier will kill the person next to them
(clockwise) and pass the knife to the third person. This cycle is repeated going around the circle until only one 
soldier is left. Josephus secretly wants to survive, so he finds the position he should choose in the circle with $N$
soldiers including himself. What is this position for $N$ soldiers?
