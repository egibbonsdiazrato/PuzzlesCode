## The Perimeter of a Rectangle Solution

Let the perimeter and area be equal to a positive, real constant $P=A=c$. Let the sides of the rectangles be $x$ and 
$y$. The expressions below follow from the perimeter and area of a rectangle:

$$ P = c = 2(x + y) \implies y = -x + \frac{c}{2} $$
$$ A = c = xy \implies y = \frac{c}{x} $$

By equating both equations, rearrange for $x$:
$$ x = \frac{c}{4} \pm \sqrt{\frac{c^2}{16} - c} $$

The two solutions of the quadratic occur due to the fact that either side of the rectangle, which satisfies the equal
perimeter-area condition, can be taken as x. For the square root to return a real value, 
$\frac{c^2}{16} - c \geq 0 \implies c \geq 4$. It is interesting to note that the first point where the square root 
is non-negative is $c=16$. For $c=16$, the rectangle is actually a square. Then, for increasing values of $c$, there
are two solutions for the reason stated previously.

Therefore, as $c=1$ is smaller than the limiting, square case, $c=16$, no rectangle can have a perimeter and area of 1.
Additionally, as $c=100$ is greater than the limiting, square case, $c=16$, there is a rectangle which can have a 
perimeter and area of 100.
